# Crash-RNN
Recurrent Neural Network and helper methods used to find the optimal strategy for the gambling game Crash on Roobet.com
This model only demonstrates the extent to which the game is skewed -- it is actually quite a terrible model and I should probably update this at some point.  I should have used regularization and created an even split between loss/winning rounds to actually try and beat the game - the goal was actually just to examine how the game works at a low level to determine a profitable strategy, which I was successful in accomplishing.  That being said, the model itself was largely redundant as most of these insights came from data analysis.  This project is still an interesting benchmark in my progress so I will leave it up.
